# Laravext

First things first (so I don't get sued)

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

This project has no financial intent, and is meerly a Frankenstein of Inertia and NextJs. I fully disclose that it may contain code that is straight up ~~copied from~~ inspired by [inertia](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia/) and [inertia-laravel](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel) repos ~~, and changed to fit my needs~~.

Although I might create a website for documentations, I will never run any adds on it, unless one day both NextJs and Inertia companies allow me. I DO NOT want any donations. 

I'm not responsible for anything you do with this code.

This section is just so I don't get my ass sued by any of them

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

This project was supposed to be just an attempt of using what I (personally) considered to be the best parts of Inertia and NextJs together in a project in a simpler way. Then I relized I could actually try to make a composer package out it to use it in other projects.

It may contain some code that

I don't claim that this is supposed to replace or be better then NextJS/Inertia, because I don't think I even have that kind of expertise, but this might be a good way for me to

1. Learn about how to build a composer package
2. Maybe provide a good tool for whoever think this might be usefull for them

I might stop supporting this at any given time, so please be aware of that before using it for anything that might be too important to you.

PRs are welcome, but I may ignore them at my disclosure. 

But hey, this is open-source, so fork it and to whatever the hell you want with it.

This is my first composer package. This repo is my side project. This repo may contain flaws/bad choices (but who doesn't). Use it if you like, ignore it if you hate it.
