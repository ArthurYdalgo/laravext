This project was supposed to be just an attempt of using what I (personally) considered to be the best parts of Inertia and NextJs together in a project in a simpler way. Then I relized I could actually try to make a composer package out it to use it in other projects.

I don't claim that this is supposed to replace or be better then NextJS/Inertia, because I don't think I even have that kind of expertise, but this might be a good way for me to

1. Learn about how to build a composer package
2. Maybe provide a good tool for whoever think this might be usefull for them

I might stop supporting this at any given time, so please be aware of that before using it for anything that might be too important to you.

PRs are welcome, but I may ignore them at my disclosure. 

But hey, this is open-source, so fork it and to whatever the hell you want with it.
