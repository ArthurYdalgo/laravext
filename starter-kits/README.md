# Starter Kits

This directory contains starter kits (in React and Vue3) for new projects using Laravext. They are all based on the [official Laravel 12 starter kits](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits). Additionally, there's also a Postman Collection and Environment file to help you test the API. Additional instructions can be found in each starter kit's README file.

If you have any suggestions or improvements, please let me know by opening an issue or a pull request.
