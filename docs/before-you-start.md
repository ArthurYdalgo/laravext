This documentation assumes that you have some experience with PHP, Laravel and Javascript, and also that you already have a development environment that meets the requirements to run a Laravel project.

## Example Standards <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Throught this documentation you may see some examples that might be React/Vue/Svelte specific. I might use `[some_file_name].(vue|jsx|svelte)` as a name for a file, assuming that you'll know that it may change depending on what you're using. If the example is **too** specific I will show implementations on all of them. Please submit a PR if you think that an example is not clear enough and you think it use some improvements.

The examples are meant to help you understand how to use these tools, and are not meant to reflect how a real world application would be designed, so everything will be as simple as possible.
