This documentation assumes that you have some experience with PHP, Laravel and Javascript, and also that you already have a development environment that meets the requirements to run a Laravel project.

## Example Standards <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Because this set of tools is meant to be used with React/Vue, you should be aware of some standards...

I might use `.jsx` as an extension for most files, assuming that you'll know that it may change depending on what you're using or what you're using it for (that means changing to `.vue`, `.tsx`, etc).

If I'm showing some code that wouldn't vary much betweem those libraries/frameworks (one or two lines), I might just show how it's be done for each one of them in the surrouding lines.

If the example is **too** specific, such as a component/page/etc, I will show implementations on all of them. Please submit a PR if you think that an example is not clear enough and you think it could use some improvements.

The examples are meant to help you understand how to use these tools, and are not meant to reflect how a real world application would be designed, so everything will be as simple as possible.
