# Examples

This section will contain some examples of how to use Laravext in your project. As mentioned in [Before You Start](/before-you-start), these are based on the [example projects present in the repository](https://github.com/ArthurYdalgo/laravext/tree/main/examples), so you can check them out to see how they work. Some examples might diverge from the actual project, like a route not being manually declared, etc.

Please check one of the following subsections to see the examples:
